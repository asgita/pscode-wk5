// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

2 + 4 = 6

num1 + num2 = sum
   2 + 4 = 6
print sum
   6

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

     Even 
if its odd repeat the process with other number

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

     input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 ====1,2,3,4,5

     avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5  1+2+3+4+5/5 =15/5 =3

    small = n1

     large = n2

    for i = 1 to 5:

   if n1 > n2 then:

       small = n1

   if n1 < n2: then:

       large = n2

   print("Average:", avg) = 3

    print("Smallest:", minimum)=1

     print("Largest:", maximum)=5

I have taken 1 to 5 numbers and added  to found out the average of 5 numbers.
